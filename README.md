## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here I am. A 28-yo computer and sound lover. 

I've worked as sound technician for 8 years and I've started computer engineering university in September 2020. 

My short-time goal is to grow-up as a full-stack developer.

My long-time goal will be the acoustic engineering master in Milan which needs computer engineering degree and experience.

Enjoy my learn-topics sharing and send me your feedback!
